# Projects

These are a list of a couple projects I have worked on, some on my own, and some from courses I have taken.

# SnakeGame:
This is an in class project that I made in a data structures class using c++. This is a very simple snake game that uses linked lists as a snake. Since I didn't know how to use a GUI in c++, I used printing as the game board. This also only works on windows as it uses windows.h. It constantly deletes and updates the board causing it to look like the snake is moving.

# StockTrackerPython:
This is a project I made on my own for fun, it is pretty simple but thought it would be fun to do. It asks the user to input 5 or less stocks, as well as the date the user started investing. It then asks the user for each date and amount of money put in, then calculates the total return from all the investements to the current date.
